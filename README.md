# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

  1.  Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
  2.  Describe the perceptron model and its components.
  3.  Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
  4.  Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
  5.  Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
  6.  Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
  7.  Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
  8.  Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.

## Results

  ### Data Preprocessing

    What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    
    What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
    
    What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
