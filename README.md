# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

  1.  Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
  2.  Describe the perceptron model and its components.
  3.  Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
  4.  Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.
  5.  Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
  6.  Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
  7.  Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
  8.  Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.
